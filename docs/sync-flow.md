# Sync flow

How `openFile`, `syncCurrentEditor`, `syncTextsWithServer`, and `syncLocalFileWithServer` hand off work, and how the server knows what to send or receive.

## Triggers and who calls whom

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    U[User: sidebar click, link click, popstate] -->|openFile| OF[openFile]
    Timer1[setInterval 1000ms saver] -->|syncCurrentEditor| SCE[syncCurrentEditor]
    Focus[focusin / focus event] -->|syncCurrentEditor| SCE
    Timer2[setInterval syncTexts + syncMedia] -->|syncTextsWithServer| STS[syncTextsWithServer]

    OF -->|save previous editor before swapping| SCE
    SCE -->|switchAwayEditor=false: end of fn| SLF[syncLocalFileWithServer]
    STS -->|per-file path| POST1[POST /syncText per file]
    SLF --> POST2[POST /syncText]

    STS -->|batch modified/deleted| POST3[POST /syncTexts]
```

The red node is the drift-seal line (files.js:1028). If `currentEditor` was rotated by anything during the yellow await above, this write lands on the wrong editor instance.

## syncCurrentEditor — both flag branches

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Enter([syncCurrentEditor switchAwayEditor]) --> G1{files undef, debug,<br/>or path undefined?}
    G1 -->|yes| Ret1([return])
    G1 -->|no| G2{isSaving OR<br/>isMessingWithCurrentEditor?}
    G2 -->|yes| Ret2([return])
    G2 -->|no| SetFlag[isMessingWithCurrentEditor = true;<br/>path = currentEditor.path]

    SetFlag --> IsInbox{path == INBOX_PATH?}
    IsInbox -->|yes| InboxBranch[inbox sync logic]
    InboxBranch --> Ret3([return])

    IsInbox -->|no| RenameCheck{firstLine's filename<br/>!= current filename?}
    RenameCheck -->|yes| Rename[await remove path<br/>await getFileHandle newPath<br/>await writeIfContentIsDifferent<br/>await renderSidebar]
    Rename --> Ret4([return])
    RenameCheck -->|no| DiffCheck[await isContentEqual<br/>path, getCurrentContent]

    DiffCheck --> SameGuard{isCurrentEditorSame?}
    SameGuard -->|no| Ret5([return])
    SameGuard -->|yes| ModCheck{contentWasModifiedLocally<br/>AND editor.isClean?}

    ModCheck -->|yes| SwitchGate{switchAwayEditor?}
    SwitchGate -->|true: skip reload| Clear[isMessingWithCurrentEditor = false]
    SwitchGate -->|false: reload from disk| Reload[await openFile path, false]
    Reload --> Clear

    ModCheck -->|editor dirty| Save[write editor content to disk;<br/>editor.markClean]
    Save --> Clear
    ModCheck -->|neither| Clear

    Clear --> ServerGate{switchAwayEditor?}
    ServerGate -->|true: skip server sync| Done([return])
    ServerGate -->|false| PushServer[await syncLocalFileWithServer path]
    PushServer --> Done

    style Rename fill:#faa,stroke:#900,color:#000
    style Reload fill:#fca,stroke:#c80,color:#000
    style SwitchGate fill:#cfc,stroke:#070,color:#000
    style ServerGate fill:#cfc,stroke:#070,color:#000
```

The two green gates are the `switchAwayEditor` branches. The orange `Reload` is the one we neutralised (it used to recurse into `openFile` without an `el` arg and clobber the main editor). The red `Rename` block is the executioner that actually deletes and creates files on disk — still live, fires whenever first-line header disagrees with filename.

## Sync with the server — batch vs per-file

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server

    Note over Client: syncTextsWithServer fires
    Client->>Client: collect modified and deleted files (skip editor and editor2 paths)
    Client->>Server: POST /syncTexts with modified, deleted, timestamps
    Server-->>Client: files, timestamps, renames
    Client->>Client: write non-current files to disk and update server.files snapshot
    Client->>Client: advance per-dir timestamp pointers

    Note over Client: syncCurrentEditor finishes the switchAwayEditor=false branch
    Client->>Client: syncLocalFileWithServer for the active editor
    Client->>Server: POST /syncText with path, lastModified, clientLastModified, clientLastSynced, content
    alt notModified
        Server-->>Client: notModified
        Client->>Client: advance lastClientModified only
    else updatedOnServer
        Server-->>Client: updatedOnServer with new lastModified
        Client->>Client: record the server lastModified, no disk write
    else merged or ok
        Server-->>Client: content and lastModified
        Client->>Client: writeIfContentIsDifferent, then openFile if path matches editor.path
    end
```

### How the server knows there's something to sync

Two mechanisms, running in parallel:

1. **Batch: `syncTextsWithServer` → `POST /syncTexts`.** The client sends:
   - `modified`: files whose disk `lastModified` is newer than the `lastClientSynced` pointer recorded in `server.files` for that path.
   - `deleted`: files present in the client's `server.files` snapshot but no longer on disk.
   - `timestamps`: a per-directory pointer telling the server "everything I've seen up to here." The server replies with files newer than each directory's pointer. **The two currently-open editor files are skipped on both send and receive** (`files.js:230` and `files.js:577`) — they're handled by the per-file path instead, to avoid racing with the user's active edits.

2. **Per-file: `syncLocalFileWithServer` → `POST /syncText`.** Called at the end of each `syncCurrentEditor` (when `switchAwayEditor=false`). Sends the single file's content plus its `lastModified` + `clientLastModified` + `clientLastSynced`. The server compares timestamps and responds with one of four statuses that the client maps to either "advance pointers only" or "write this content to disk."

The client's `server.files` object holds the triple `(content, lastModified, lastClientModified)` per path — this is the client's view of what the server thinks the world looks like, and the basis for deciding which files to include in the next `modified`/`deleted` lists. Persisted to `localStorage` under `SERVER_STORAGE_KEY`.

## Where the recent bug lived, in one sentence

The `switchAwayEditor` flag was added so that `syncCurrentEditor`, when called from `openFile`'s "save previous editor" path, does not take the orange `Reload` branch — the one that recursed into `openFile` without an `el`. That recursion used to rotate the global `currentEditor` under the outer `openFile`'s feet, which then wrote `.path` onto the wrong editor instance (the red node in the openFile diagram), producing a poisoned state that the red `Rename` block later turned into a destructive file duplication.
